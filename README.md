This repository contains the following two scripts:
- normalize_text.py
- visualization.py

normalize_text.py is the plain text normalization and processing script that can be invoked via command line, and is also called as a function in visualization.py

visualization.py is a script that visualizes tokens and their occurences on a bar plot using matplotlib

To run visualization.py, open the terminal in the directory where the two python scripts are located and simply type: python visualization.py
